# UI-UX-DESIGN--TASK-7

Problems Identified (Original Design)

The “Add to Cart” option appeared only on hover — not immediately visible.

Product cards lacked user ratings and quick info (price variations, availability).

Visual hierarchy was weak — similar font weights made prices and CTAs less noticeable.

The layout felt dense on desktop, with little breathing space.

No quick details like customer reviews or sustainability information.

Changes Made (Redesigned Version)

Added visible “Add to Cart” buttons without hover to improve accessibility.

Included star ratings for social proof and decision confidence.

Increased price visibility using bold typography.

Added labels such as “Limited Release” and “Back in Stock” with color cues for urgency.

Enhanced button contrast and hover effect for better interaction feedback.

Added a Quick Info section with price, rating, and formats to help faster decisions.

Improved spacing and alignment for a cleaner, modern layout.

Made CTAs consistent across sections (“Shop All Craft Instant”, “Shop Best Sellers”).
